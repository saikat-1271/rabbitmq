🧩 2. Simple System Design Doc (system-design.md)
📦 Stock Sync Flow
Vendors expose stock APIs.

A scheduled job (@Cron) or a CLI triggers sync.

The system fetches stock from each vendor and updates local PostgreSQL.

🧾 Order Placement Architecture
REST API /order accepts orders.

Orders are validated, saved to DB with PENDING status.

Pushed to RabbitMQ order_queue.

⚙️ Queue-Based Worker Model
RabbitMQ consumes messages via a worker service.

Worker validates stock availability (strong consistency check).

Updates stock, marks order as CONFIRMED or FAILED.

🔐 Consistency Guarantees
Strong Consistency: Local stock is treated as source of truth during order placement.

Eventually Consistent: Vendor stock via sync jobs.

Idempotency: Queue workers use nack or ack logic with retries.
